When taking your photo, please focus on the part of the crop that shows the most obvious symptoms, for example; an entire leaf or portion of the leaf showing the disease, an entire fruit or seed head showing the symptoms. Avoid photos showing an entire plant or having hands and fingers in the way of the plant or disease. Good light and good focus are very helpful. If the crop clinic gives an inaccurate result please let us know as this information helps us to train it for the future. We are currently diagnosing diseases in Cassava, Yam, Maize and Sorgum.
