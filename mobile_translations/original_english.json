When taking your photo, please focus on the part of the crop that shows the most obvious symptoms, for example; an entire leaf or portion of the leaf showing the disease, an entire fruit or seed head showing the symptoms. Avoid photos showing an entire plant or having hands and fingers in the way of the plant or disease. Good light and good focus are very helpful. If the crop clinic gives an inaccurate result please let us know as this information helps us to train it for the future. We are currently diagnosing diseases in Cassava, Yam, Maize and Sorgum.

    "faq1q": "Can I use FarmSmarter without internet connection?",
    "faq1a": "The Beta version of FarmSmarter is a web app, and needs internet connection. Once the mobile version is launched you will be able to use the mobile app offline at times but will require internet for full functionality.",
    "faq2q": "Do I have to be a farmer to use FarmSmarter?",
    "faq2a": "No, you don't have to be a farmer! FarmSmarter is great for anyone growing crops. Our Beta version gives farmers the best experience and we will be adding more tools in future versions for wholesalers, transporters, shoppers and finance providers. By joining FarmSmarter as an early user you will be given early access to new tools for your user type as soon as they become available. In the meantime you will be connected with other FarmSmarter users via the chat forums.",
    "faq3q": "What does it cost to use the FarmSmarter app?",
    "faq3a": "The Beta version of FarmSmarter is a free web app at present. Beta users will have preferential lifetime priveledges. Future versions and tools will be provided on a subscription basis, depending on factors such as farm size and commercial use.",
    "faq4q": "I can't see the crop I want to grow - why?",
    "faq4a": " We are working on building a full library of crops, diseases and pests. This is a giant task and will be continued as we get feedback from you. There is an option in the app to suggest new crops, these will be added to our list as soon as we can get information for you. In the meantime you can specify new crops but won't have the full growing information",
    "faq5q": "My crop disease wasn't recognised - why?",
    "faq5a": "We are working on building a full library of crops, diseases and pests. Our AI Crop Clinic is currently trained to recognise a small selection of crop diseases, it is continually learning based on new information. This is a giant task and will be continued as we get feedback from you. In the meantime, if the  disease diagnosis isn't correct, you can let us know in the app and we will provide suggestions of other diseases that may affect the crop you have selected.",
    "faq6q": "How do I get the FarmSmarter app?",
    "faq6a": "FarmSmarter is currently being tested by a selected group of farmers - we are always looking for new testers to join us so please sign up if you would like to get involved.",
    "faq7q": "How can the field map help me?",
    "faq7a": "FarmSmarter's field mapping facility allows you to either draw the outline of your field or simply walk the boundary and it does the work for you. Our system then calculates the area of the field and can provide yield estimates for your crops, location specific farming advice and enable you to collaborate with other local farmers.",
    "faq8q": "Can I start an online shop with FarmSmarter?",
    "faq8a": "Yes - FarmSmarter will offer verified users the option to build an e-commerce shop for their products and services (this is coming soon).",
    "faq9q": "How do I keep up to date with FarmSmarter news?",
